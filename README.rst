**Warning**: ``TensorFlow 2.0`` is not officially released yet, the first official
release of ``barrage`` will be after ``TensorFlow 2.0`` is released.

Barrage is an opinionated supervised deep learning tool built on top of
``TensorFlow 2.x`` designed to standardize and orchestrate the training and scoring of
complicated models. Barrage is built around a ``JSON`` config and the
``TensorFlow 2.x`` library using the ``Tensorflow.Keras`` API.


Official documentation can be found at: https://barrage.readthedocs.io/

------------------
Guiding Principles
------------------

#. **Minimal Code**: build well-tested, configurable, and reliable config recipes.
   Use custom code only when it is absolutely necessary.

#. **Component Reusability**: decompose deep learning dataset processing into
   fundamental components (e.g. dataset loaders, data transformations,
   augmentation functions) to maximize reuse between models.

#. **Process Automation**: best practices and artifacting are automatically configured
   (e.g. saving best checkpoint, creating TensorBoard, etc...) with defaults that can
   be adjusted in the config.

#. **Standardize API**: takes an opinionated view and selects the production hardened
   variant of the many ``TensorFlow.Keras`` API choices (e.g. data type choices in
   model.fit).

#. **Cross Domain**: handles single/multi input/output networks seamlessly across
   domains (e.g. Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, etc...).

-------------------------
Select Feature Highlights
-------------------------

#. **Single/multi input/output**: flexible across many types of networks.

#. **Loading**: dataset in memory, on disk, in cloud storage, etc ...

#. **Transforms**: fit transforms on a first-pass of the training dataset with the
   ability to:

   #. pass transform params to network builder (e.g. compute vocabulary size ->
      embedding layer).

   #. apply transform at batch time (e.g. mean variance normalization to input).

   #. undo transform after scoring (e.g. undo mean variance normalization to output).

#. **Augmentation**: chain augmentation functions.

#. **Sampling**: change the number of times a sample is selected in an epoch.

As well as standard ``TensorFlow.Keras`` features such as learning rate scheduling,
sample weights, etc...
